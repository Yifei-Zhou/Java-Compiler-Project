## Project Summary:

This is a complete and functional compiler development project.

This compiler is built for a new language 'uC', which is a new language I developed. 'uC' is a simplified version of C language, which combines the grammars from several different programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C. 'uC' is an Object-oriented programming language, and it supports many critical components of a programming language, such as control structures (if, while), functions, type checking, explicit/implicit type conversions, arrays, pointers, etc.

This compiler development project uses a parser generator: [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/), to generate a parser in Java that can build and walk parse trees from uC grammar. Then, ANTLR can be configured to automatically generate ASTs (Abstract Syntax Tree), which are hierarchical representations of the syntactic structure of a program. Finally, we perform a walk of the generated ASTs and generate Risc-V assembly codes.

Besides, this compiler also performs register allocation to minimize the number of loads and stores by doing basic block splitting and global/local variables liveness analysis. 


## Background of Compiler

The first step of a compiler is checking whether a program is valid: 1. Does it use the correct "vocabulary" (keywords, operators, variable names); 2. Does it use proper "grammar" (do for and while loops have the correct structure, etc.). A compiler uses two tools to accomplish the validation check:

1. A *scanner* that reads in a stream of characters and *tokenizes* them into the constituent words of the language -- the keywords, operators, variable names, etc.
2. A *parser* that consumes a stream of tokens (as identified by the scanner) into a *parse tree*, which is a representation of the structure of the program.

Example:

```
cur = cur + 4;
```

The *scanner* will convert the code above into 6 tokens: 

```
IDENT(cur) OP(=) IDENT(cur) OP(+) LIT(4) SEMI
```

The *parser* will then converts this stream of tokens (generated by *scanner*) into a parse tree to capture the code's structure:
